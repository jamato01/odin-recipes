# odin-recipes
This is a project that odin is having me complete regarding recipes. I will be using my html skills to complete it.

Reflection:
Overall, the biggest thing I took from this project is the difficulty of finding source images. I still thing I could have done a better job with them with providing credit using the <figure> attribute, but I left that for later as I won't be using this for anything commercial.
Another thing I found difficult was using git. I had some issues writing my commits and figuring out how to do them properly. I ended up having some issues when I tried to load my website because I was committing from the wrong folder; nothing cd couldn't help fix. Fun project overall, ready for CSS!
